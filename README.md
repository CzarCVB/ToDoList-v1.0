# ToDoList-v1.0
Just my first repo. Some project I made for a course I'm doing on Web Development.
 It's a todo list app. You can create new To-Do items and check out the old ones.
 Currently I don't have the time to work on it, but will def bring changes in the future or include this project in some other big project.
 Tech: Back-end done with Node + Express
